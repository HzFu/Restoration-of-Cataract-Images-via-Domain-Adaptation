# Restoration-of-Cataract-Images-via-Domain-Adaptation
There is little access to large datasets of cataract images paired with their corresponding clear ones. Therefore, it is unlikely to build a restoration model for cataract images through supervised learning.

Here, we propose an unsupervised restoration method via cataract-like image simulation and domain adaptation.

The code of this study will be released soon.
